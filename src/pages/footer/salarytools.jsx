            Comprehensive Salary Tools
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>💰 Salary Calculators:</strong> Salary calculators allow you
            to input your job title, location, and experience level to get an
            estimate of the typical salary range for your position. These tools
            take into account factors such as industry trends, geographic
            variations, and company size to provide accurate salary data.
            Popular salary calculators include those offered by Glassdoor,
            PayScale, and Indeed.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>📊 Industry Reports:</strong> Accessing detailed industry
            reports can give you a broader understanding of salary trends within
            your field. These reports often include information on average
            salaries, benefits, and compensation packages for various roles and
            experience levels. Resources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics
            (BLS) and professional associations often publish these reports
            annually.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>🏙️ Cost of Living Comparisons:</strong> When considering job
            offers in different locations, it’s important to factor in the cost
            of living. Cost of living comparison tools help you understand how
            far your salary will go in different cities. Websites like Numbeo
            and Expatistan provide detailed comparisons of living expenses,
            allowing you to make informed decisions about relocating for a job.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>📈 Salary Surveys:</strong> Participating in salary surveys
            or accessing their results can provide valuable insights into what
            others in your profession are earning. These surveys are often
            conducted by industry associations, professional networks, and
            recruitment agencies. They offer a snapshot of current compensation
            trends and can be a useful benchmark for your salary negotiations.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>🏢 Company Reviews:</strong> Websites like Glassdoor and
            Indeed offer company reviews where current and former employees
            share their experiences, including information about salaries and
            benefits. Reviewing these insights can give you a sense of what to
            expect from a potential employer and help you gauge whether their
            compensation packages are competitive.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>🤝 Negotiation Resources:</strong> Negotiating your salary
            can be intimidating, but with the right resources, you can approach
            it with confidence. There are numerous online guides, articles, and
            videos that offer strategies for effective salary negotiation.
            Websites like The Muse and LinkedIn Learning provide valuable tips
            on how to present your case, handle counteroffers, and secure the
            best possible compensation.
